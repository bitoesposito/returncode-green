# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive digital certificate system for post-course certification without blockchain technology. The system integrates with the existing NestJS backend architecture, leveraging the current User entity, MinIO storage service, and audit logging system. It uses digital signatures (RSA/ECDSA) to ensure certificate authenticity and integrity. Users can generate certificates upon course completion, store them securely on MinIO, and allow third parties to verify their authenticity using cryptographic verification.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a course administrator, I want to generate digital certificates for students who complete courses, so that I can provide verifiable proof of their achievements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a course is completed THEN the system SHALL generate a certificate with unique UUID, user information from existing User entity, and timestamp
2. WHEN generating a certificate THEN the system SHALL save the certificate file to MinIO storage using existing MinioService
3. WHEN saving a certificate THEN the system SHALL calculate SHA256 hash of the certificate content
4. WHEN calculating hash THEN the system SHALL sign the hash using RSA/ECDSA private key stored securely
5. WHEN signing is complete THEN the system SHALL store certificate metadata in PostgreSQL using TypeORM entity
6. WHEN certificate is created THEN the system SHALL log the action using existing AuditService
7. IF certificate generation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate ApiResponseDto error and rollback any partial operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a certificate holder, I want to share my certificate ID with employers or institutions, so that they can independently verify my credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a certificate is generated THEN the system SHALL return a unique certificate ID to the user
2. WHEN certificate ID is provided THEN the system SHALL allow public access to verification endpoint
3. WHEN verification is requested THEN the system SHALL not require authentication
4. IF certificate ID is invalid THEN the system SHALL return clear error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an employer or institution, I want to verify the authenticity of a digital certificate, so that I can trust the credentials presented to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN verification is requested THEN the system SHALL retrieve certificate data from database
2. WHEN certificate data is found THEN the system SHALL download original file from MinIO
3. WHEN file is retrieved THEN the system SHALL recalculate SHA256 hash
4. WHEN hash is calculated THEN the system SHALL verify signature using corresponding public key
5. WHEN verification succeeds THEN the system SHALL return valid status with certificate details
6. WHEN verification fails THEN the system SHALL return invalid status with failure reason
7. IF certificate is revoked THEN the system SHALL return invalid status regardless of signature validity

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage cryptographic keys securely, so that the certificate system maintains its integrity and trustworthiness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system is deployed THEN the system SHALL use RSA or ECDSA key pairs for signing stored in secure keys directory
2. WHEN signing certificates THEN the system SHALL use private key loaded via ConfigService from environment variables
3. WHEN verifying certificates THEN the system SHALL use corresponding public key identified by public_key_id
4. WHEN key rotation is needed THEN the system SHALL support multiple public keys with identifiers in database
5. WHEN keys are accessed THEN the system SHALL log key usage through existing AuditService
6. IF private key is compromised THEN the system SHALL support key revocation and replacement

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a certificate holder, I want to download my certificate file, so that I can store it locally or share it directly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN download is requested THEN the system SHALL authenticate the requesting user using existing JWT guards
2. WHEN user is authorized THEN the system SHALL retrieve certificate file from MinIO using existing MinioService
3. WHEN file is retrieved THEN the system SHALL return the original certificate file with proper content headers
4. WHEN download occurs THEN the system SHALL log the action using existing AuditService
5. IF user is not authorized THEN the system SHALL deny access with appropriate ApiResponseDto error
6. IF certificate file is not found THEN the system SHALL return file not found error using standard HTTP status codes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to revoke certificates when necessary, so that I can invalidate certificates that should no longer be considered valid.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN revocation is requested THEN the system SHALL mark certificate as revoked in database
2. WHEN certificate is revoked THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trail of revocation
3. WHEN revoked certificate is verified THEN the system SHALL return invalid status
4. WHEN revocation is processed THEN the system SHALL not delete the original certificate file
5. IF certificate is already revoked THEN the system SHALL handle duplicate revocation gracefully

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to follow security best practices, so that the certificate system is resistant to common attacks and vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling file uploads THEN the system SHALL validate file types and sizes
2. WHEN storing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL use appropriate encryption
3. WHEN exposing APIs THEN the system SHALL implement proper input validation
4. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting
5. WHEN logging operations THEN the system SHALL not log sensitive cryptographic material
6. IF security violation is detected THEN the system SHALL log the incident appropriately

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a frontend user, I want an intuitive interface to verify certificates, so that I can easily check certificate authenticity without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing verification page THEN the system SHALL provide simple input field for certificate ID using Angular reactive forms
2. WHEN verification is submitted THEN the system SHALL display clear loading indicator using PrimeNG components
3. WHEN verification completes THEN the system SHALL show clear valid/invalid status with visual indicators using PrimeNG Toast notifications
4. WHEN certificate is valid THEN the system SHALL display certificate details including user info and timestamp in structured format
5. WHEN certificate is invalid THEN the system SHALL display reason for invalidity using existing error handling patterns
6. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL use existing HttpClient service with proper error interceptors
7. IF network error occurs THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error message with retry option using existing notification service

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the certificate system to integrate seamlessly with existing backend architecture, so that it follows established patterns and maintains code consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the certificates module THEN the system SHALL follow existing NestJS module structure with proper imports and exports
2. WHEN defining certificate entity THEN the system SHALL use TypeORM decorators consistent with existing entities (User, UserProfile, AuditLog)
3. WHEN creating DTOs THEN the system SHALL use class-validator decorators following existing patterns in auth.dto.ts and users.dto.ts
4. WHEN implementing service methods THEN the system SHALL return ApiResponseDto format consistent with existing services
5. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL use existing NestJS exception classes (BadRequestException, NotFoundException, etc.)
6. WHEN adding to app.module.ts THEN the system SHALL register the new Certificate entity in TypeORM entities array
7. WHEN implementing controllers THEN the system SHALL use existing guard patterns (JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard) where appropriate
8. WHEN accessing configuration THEN the system SHALL use existing ConfigService patterns for environment variables
